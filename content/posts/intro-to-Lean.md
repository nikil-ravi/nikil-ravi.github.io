# Introduction to Lean

Lean is a functional programming language that doubles as an interactive theorem prover. It combines the elegance of functional programming with powerful formal verification capabilities, making it ideal for both software development and mathematical proofs.

## What is Lean?

Lean was created by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research and is now developed as an open-source project. Unlike traditional proof assistants like Coq or Isabelle, Lean emphasizes:

- **Performance**: Fast compilation and execution
- **Usability**: Clean, readable syntax
- **Interactivity**: Real-time feedback and proof development
- **Extensibility**: Metaprogramming capabilities

## Basic Mathematical Expressions

Lean supports mathematical notation seamlessly. Here are some examples:

**Inline math:** $\alpha + \beta$

**Display math:**
$$\alpha + \beta$$

## Defining Types

In Lean, we use the `inductive` keyword to define new types. Here's how we define the natural numbers:

```lean
inductive Nat : Type
  | zero : Nat
  | succ : Nat â†’ Nat
```

This creates a type `Nat` with two constructors: `zero` and `succ` (successor).

## Functions and Recursion

We can define functions using pattern matching and recursion:

```lean
def add (n m : Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | zero => m
  | succ n' => succ (add n' m)
```

This defines addition recursively: `add n m` adds `n` and `m` by repeatedly applying the successor function.

## Theorem Proving

One of Lean's most powerful features is its theorem proving capabilities. Here's a simple proof by induction:

```lean {linenos=true}
theorem add_zero (n : Nat) : add n zero = n := by
  induction n
  case zero =>
    rfl  -- reflexive equality, since add zero zero = zero
  case succ n' ih =>
    rw [add, ih]  -- rewrite using the inductive hypothesis
```

This theorem states that adding zero to any natural number `n` gives back `n`. The proof uses mathematical induction:

1. **Base case**: When `n = zero`, we have `add zero zero = zero` by definition
2. **Inductive step**: Assuming `add n' zero = n'` for some `n'`, we show `add (succ n') zero = succ n'`

## Why Lean Matters

Lean is particularly valuable because:

- **Formal Verification**: Prove code correctness mathematically
- **Education**: Learn programming and logic simultaneously
- **Research**: Build new mathematical theories and verify them
- **Industry**: Ensure critical software systems are bug-free

## Getting Started

To install Lean, you can use the official installer or package managers:

```bash
# Using curl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh

# Or using package managers
# macOS with Homebrew: brew install lean
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install lean
```

Then create your first Lean file:

```lean
def hello := "Hello, Lean!"

#eval hello  -- This will print "Hello, Lean!"
```

## Next Steps

This post only scratches the surface of what Lean can do. In future posts, we'll explore:

- Dependent types and their applications
- Advanced theorem proving techniques
- Building verified data structures
- Integration with other programming languages

Lean represents the future of software development where correctness is guaranteed through mathematical proof rather than just testing.
