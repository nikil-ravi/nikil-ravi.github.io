I started my undergraduate studies at UIUC wanting to eventually pursue a PhD in math and become a math researcher. For the first two years of undergrad, I was in what I call "math mode". After my second year, when I took two AI classes in one semester and did a summer internship applying AI to gravitational wave detection, I switched to what I now think of as the "deep learning mindset", and further adopted this mindset as I pursued in MS in AI at Stanford.

In the math mindset, my thinking was oriented around proofs, correctness, and preciseness. I would refuse to listen to something that was not well-defined, since in math the onus of defining something falls on "them" (the person making the claim), not me. Nothing mattered until it was rigorously proved, et cetera.

In the deep learning mindset, things are very different. Everything is hand-waved away. Empirical results matter much more. No one cares about proof; rather people just try different things (architectures, datasets, loss functions, learning paradigms) till something works. If something works better, you just adopt it without worrying about proving anything about its optimality, well-definedness, statistical guarantees, etc.

Initially, I was quite annoyed by this. But I came to embrace it, and now find both these mindsets quite helpful in daily life.

The deep learning mindset teaches you that if you are unsure of something, instead of falling prey to the very tempting solution of hand-engineering heuristics, you should instead just focus on getting your initial conditions, learning signal, and architecture right. 

This often applies to temas of people, for example. In any group project (eg. a startup), if your initial team is excellent (great init, architecture), and you listen to your empirical results (market feedback, research results), move fast (good learning rate), and backprop signals into the company well, you will win. The math mindset will result in analysis-paralysis, and thus does not work well here.

This mindset shift also applies to other fields- programming has a certain mindset, and so do physics, chemistry, rocketry, manufacturing, etc. Being able to pick up these mindsets, and decide which model of thought applies to a given situation in life seems to be a super valuable skill.
