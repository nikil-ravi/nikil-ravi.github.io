One mode of thinking that has helped me so far is what I call "pre-critiquing". People are often much better 
at critiquing something than making it well. One can leverage this asymmetry by pre-critiquing one's own work. I often 
ask myself "how would I expect myself to do this?", or "to what standard would I hold someone else that did this task?". Then, I just go through that list and try to fix as much as I can. This mindset seems trivial, but actually implementing in my daily life, and the separation of concerns that comes with thinking about the critique and fix separately, have helped me a lot.
