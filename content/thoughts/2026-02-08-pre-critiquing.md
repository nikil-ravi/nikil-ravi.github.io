One mode of thinking that has helped me is what I call "pre-critiquing". People are often much better 
at critiquing something than making it well. You can leverage this asymmetry by pre-critiquing your own work. I often 
ask myself "how would I expect myself to do this?", or "to what standard would I hold someone else that did this task?". Then, I just go through that list and try to address as much as I can. This mindset seems trivial, but actually implementing it in my daily life, and the separation of concerns that comes with thinking about the critique and fix separately, has been quite useful.
